## **Scenario 4 - Backup and Recovery**
A virtual machine is protected by a locally redundant storage account, which means that it is replicated and only accessible to Microsoft in the event of a datacenter outage. In this lab, we will configure a separate backup of the VM that will be user-accessible for recovery.

This lab uses the **Azure Backup Recovery Services Vault** to back up the virtual machine with the configured policy, and will be charged as per-backup pricing. A Recovery Services vault is a logical container that stores the backup data for each protected resource, such as Azure VMs. When you enable a **Virtual Machine Backup** and the backup job for a protected resource runs, it creates a recovery point inside the Recovery Services vault. You can then use one of these recovery points to restore data to a given point in time.

1. Click **Create**
1. While the RSV deploys, click **All resources** in the **Favorites** menu 

#### **Enable Virtual Machine Backup**

9. Return to the **All resources** blade and click on **DEMOLABVM01**
1. In the left pane under **Operations**, click **Backup**
