## **Scenario 4 - Backup and Recovery**
A virtual machine is protected by a locally redundant storage account, which means that it is replicated and only accessible to Microsoft in the event of a datacenter outage. In this lab, we will configure a separate backup of the VM that will be user-accessible for recovery.

This lab uses the **Azure Backup Recovery Services Vault** to back up the virtual machine with the configured policy, and will be charged as per-backup pricing. A Recovery Services vault is a logical container that stores the backup data for each protected resource, such as Azure VMs. When you enable a **Virtual Machine Backup** and the backup job for a protected resource runs, it creates a recovery point inside the Recovery Services vault. You can then use one of these recovery points to restore data to a given point in time.

#### **Create a Recovery Services vault**

 1. Click on the ![Azure Menu](https://github.com/Manesh-R/CloudLabs-Azure/blob/master/azure-virtual-machine-and-compute/instructions/images/Hamburger.jpg) menu icon at the upper left corner of the Azure portal.
 
 2. Then click on **All Services**

 4. On the **Recovery Services vaults** blade, click **+ Add**
 
 5. Select the **Subscription** you are using for the lab from dropdown menu.
 
 6. Select the existing resource group from the dropdown menu
 
 7. Provide the Vault name as <copy>**demolabRSV**</copy>
 
 8. Region: **South Central US**
 
 9. Click on **Review + Create**
 
10. Click **Create**

11. While the RSV deploys, click **All resources** in the **Favorites** menu.

#### **Enable Virtual Machine Backup**

12. Return to the **All resources** blade and Select **DEMOLABVM01**

13. In the left pane under **Operations**, click on **Backup**

14. On the **DEMOLABVM01-Backup** blade under the **Select existing** radio button, select <copy>**demolabRSV**</copy>
