# Lab 04 - Backup and Recovery

### Estimated Duration: 30 Minutes

## Overview

A virtual machine is protected by a locally redundant storage account, which means that it is replicated and only accessible to Microsoft in the event of a datacenter outage. In this lab, we will configure a separate backup of the VM that will be user-accessible for recovery.

This lab uses the **Azure Backup Recovery Services Vault** to back up the virtual machine with the configured policy, and will be charged as per-backup pricing. A Recovery Services vault is a logical container that stores the backup data for each protected resource, such as Azure VMs. When you enable a **Virtual Machine Backup** and the backup job for a protected resource runs, it creates a recovery point inside the Recovery Services vault. You can then use one of these recovery points to restore data to a given point in time.
