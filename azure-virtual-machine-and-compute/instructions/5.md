## **Scenario 6 - Connect to the VM and Install IIS**
Now you will connect to the newly created virtual machine with Azure Cloud Shell and use PowerShell to install the web-server feature and deploy a simple web page. Before installing the web-server, you will need to adjust the inbound security rule to allow Azure Cloud Shell to connect to the VM and prepare Cloud Shell for its first use. Cloud Shell machines are temporary and require a new or existing Azure Files share to be mounted as a clouddrive to persist files. On first launch, Cloud Shell prompts you to mount storage for the temporary machines it uses and in this lab you will create a new storage account for that purpose. This is a one-time step and will be automatically attached for all sessions. A single file share can be mapped and used by both Bash and PowerShell in Cloud Shell. 

#### **Update Inbound security rules**
You will now add an Inbound security rule to allow Azure Cloud Shell to connect to the VM.

 1. On the **Network interface blade**, click on **DEMOLABVM01-nsg** Network security group.
 
    ![In Network interface select NSG](images/img-7.png)
    
    >**Note**: If you are unable to see Network Security Group in Overview, click on **See more**.
 
 2. In the **DEMOLABVM01-nsg** blade, click on the **Inbound security rule**(1) under Settings. On **DEMOLABVM01-nsg-Inbound security rules** blade, click **+Add**(2).

    ![In NSG, add inbound security rule](images/nsg-add-inbound.png)
 
 3. On **Add inbound security rule** blade:
  
     - Leave default selections for **Source, Source Port ranges** and **Destination**
 
     - Set **Destination port ranges** as **80**
 
     - In the **Name** field type <copy>**demolabrule**</copy>
 
     - Click **Add**

#### **Prepare Azure Cloud Shell**
You will now prepare Azure Cloud Shell for its first use by mounting a storage account.

 4. In the **Home** of Azure Portal, click on **Virtual machines**
 
 5. On the **Virtual machines** blade, click on **DEMOLABVM01** virtual machine.

    ![selecting virtual machine](images/home-select-vm.png)
 
 6. In the **DEMOLABVM01** virtual machine pane, verify that the status of the vm is **Running**(1). If the status is still Creating, wait until the status changes to Running before completing the remaining steps.  In the **blue ribbon** at the top, click on the **Cloud shell icon**(2).

    ![Azure cloud shell](images/vm-running-status.png)

    > **Note:** If you are not able to find Cloud Shell icon, from the top navigation bar click on More portal tools icon ![Azure Menu](images/moreportaltool.png) and select Cloud shell

7. In **Azure Cloud Shell**, click **PowerShell**

    ![Azure Menu](images/S6.S7.1.png)

8. On the **You have no storage mounted** panel, click on **Show advanced settings**

    ![Azure Menu](images/S6.S8.1.png)

    > **Note:** Azure Cloud Shell requires a fileshare be mounted to your resource group to persist files used during the session. After initial use, this fileshare will be available for future Cloud shell session. 

9. In the **You have no storage mounted** panel, follow the below steps:

    - **Cloud Shell region** dropdown, Select the region you are using to perform the lab.
    
    - Under **Storage account**, select **Create new** and give the name as **demolabstorage<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/>**

    - Under **File share**, select **Create new** and type <copy>**demolab**</copy>
    
    - Click **Create storage** 

     ![Azure cloud shell](images/shell-storage-create.png)

#### **Connect to the VM**

10. Go to **azvmrg-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/>** Resource group and select **DEMOLABVM01** virtual machine.

11. From the **DEMOLABVM01** overview page copy the **Public IP** of the virtual machine.

    ![Azure virtual machine public IP](images/vm-public-ip-copy.png)

12. On your Jump-VM, click on **start**(1) and search for Remote desktop(2). Then click on **Remote desktop connection**(3).

     ![Remote desktop connection](images/start-search-rdp.png)

13. In the Remote desktop connection window paste the **Public IP** of the virtual machine we copied in *Step 11* and click on **Connect**.

     ![connect to remote desktop](images/connect-to-rdp.png)

14. Enter the following credentials to login into the RDP session and click **yes** on pop-up.

    - Username: **demouser**
    - Password: **Password.1!!**

15. Once inside the RDP session, click on **Start** and run **Windows PowerShell** as *Administrator*.

    ![windows powershell in rdp](images/windows-powershell.png)

16. Run the following commands in Powershell.

```
Install-WindowsFeature -Name Web-Server

```

   > **Note:** You have just invoked a PowerShell command to enable the Web-Server feature on the new VM that you just created. Now you will verify the web server is active and install a simple web page.
    
   > ![Powershell command to run](images/powershell-command-install.png)

#### **Verify Internet Information Services**

17. After the previous command completes, return to the **Virtual Machine blade** overview panel and **copy the Public IP address** as we done in *Step 11*.

18. Open a **new browser window** and **resize** it if necessary in the connected DEMOLABVM01.

19. In the **address bar**, paste the **public IP address** and press **Enter**

20. You should now see the **Windows Server Internet Information Services Welcome Screen**

    ![Windows Server Internet Information Services Welcome Screen](images/IIS-windows-server.png)

#### **Load a web page and monitor the VM**

21. Run the following commands in Powershell.

```
Set-Content -Path "C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\Default.htm" -Value "<html><body><h2>Congratulations!</h2><p>You have just created a basic website on $($env:computername).</p></body></html>"
```

22. After the script completes, return to the **IIS Welcome screen browser tab** and **refresh the screen**

23. You should now see a **Congratulations** message that includes your VM name **DEMOLABVM01**

    ![Windows Server Internet Information Services Welcome Screen refersh](images/windows-server-cong.png)

This completes this scenario. Click **Next** to go to the next scenario.
