## **Scenario 3 - Deploy a Virtual Machine**
In this part of the lab, we will deploy an **Azure Virtual Machine** using the foundational elements we created in the first two scenarios of this lab.

1. Click the ![Azure Menu(./images/Hamburger.jpg"Portal menu icon")![](./images/Hamburger.jpg) Azure portal menu icon in the upper left of the Azure portal
1. Click **+ Create a resource**
1. On the **New** blade, search for <copy>**Windows Server**</copy> and press **Enter**	
1. Select **Windows Server** from the search results.
1. Leave the displayed software plan and click on **Create** in the **Windows Server** blade.

#### **Basics**

5. On the **Basics** tab, under **PROJECT DETAILS** section verify a **Subscription** is listed in the **Subscription** dropdown menu
1. In the **Resource group** field, make sure that **<inject key="AzureResourceGroupName" copy="false"/>** resource group is selected in the dropdown menu
1. Type <copy>**DEMOLABVM01**</copy> in the **Virtual machine name** field, under INSTANCE DETAILS section

    > **Note:** If you see any validation error, please adjust the name.

1. In the **Region** dropdown menu, select **South Central US**
1. Choose **Availabilty set** from the **Availability options** dropdown menu
1. Select **demolabavaset1** from the **Availability set** dropdown menu
1. In the Image dropdown menu, select **Windows Server 2019 Datacenter**
1. On the **Size** field, click on **Change size** 
1. On the **Select a VM size** blade, scroll down and select **D4S_v3 Standard** box and click **Select**
1. In the **Username** field below the **ADMINISTRATOR ACCOUNT**, type <copy>**labadmin**</copy>
1. In the **Password** and **Confirm password** fields, type <copy>**Password2019**</copy>
1. Choose **None** for **Public inbound ports** field
1. Leave **No** selected under **Already have a Windows license?**

    > **Note:** If you own Windows Server licenses with active Software Assurance (SA), use Azure Hybrid Benefit to save money. [Learn More](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/hybrid-use-benefit/#services)

1. Click **Next : Disks >** to navigate to **Disks** tab

#### **Disks**
When an Azure virtual machine is created, two disks are automatically attached to the virtual machine.
An operating system disk hosts the VMs operating system and a temporary disk used for operations such as temporary data processing. Later in the lab, you will add and additional data disk for installing applications and storing data. 

19. Select **Premium SSD** option from **OS disk type** dropdown menu
1. Click on **ADVANCED** and select **yes** under **Use managed disks** 

    > **Note:** Azure Managed Disks simplifies disk management for Azure IaaS VMs by managing the storage accounts associated with the VM disks. For best performance, reliability, scalability and access control we recommend Azure Managed Disks for most virtual machine configurations. You only have to specify the type (Premium or Standard) and the size of disk you need, and Azure creates and manages the disk for you.

1. Click **Next : Networking >** to go to the **Networking** tab

#### **Networking**

22. Select the **DemoLabVnet1** virtual network from the **Virtual network** dropdown option below **Network interface**
1. Verify that **demolabsubnet** is selected in the **Subnet** field
1. Verify that the **Public IP** address field has a status that begins with **(new)**

    > **Note:** Use a public IP address if you want to communicate with the virtual machine from outside the virtual network. For example, if you will need to RDP to the VM, you will need a public IP address. 

1. In the **NIC network security group** field, select **Advanced** 
1. In the **Configure network security group**, verify **(new)DEMOLABVM01-nsg** is selected

    > **Note:** A **Network Security Group** is a set of firewall rules that control traffic to and from your virtual machine. [Learn more.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-nsg)

1. Verify that **Accelerated Networking** is **on**.

    > **Note:** Accelerated networking Enables low latency and high throughput on the network interface.

1. Click **Next : Management >** to navigate to **Management** tab.

#### **Management**

28. Leave the defaults for **Boot diagnostics**, **OS guest diagnostics** and **Diagnostics storage account** under the **MONITORING** section

    > **Note:** Azure Monitor enables you to consume telemetry to gain visibility into the performance and health of your workloads on Azure. The most important type of Azure telemetry data is the metrics (also called performance counters) emitted by most Azure resources. [Learn more.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-metrics)

1. Leave the defaults for **System assigned managed identity** and **Enable auto-shutdown** under **IDENTITY** and **AUTO-SHUTDOWN** sections respectively 
1. Click **Next : Advanced >** to go to the **Advanced** tab

#### **Advanced configuration**

31. In the **Extensions** pane, you could customize your virtual machine through the addition of extensions. You will not add an extension during this scenario, so click **Next : Tags >** to go to the **Tags** tab

#### **Tags**

32. Tags are name/value pairs that enable you to categorize resources and view consolidated billing by applying the same tag to multiple resources and resource groups

    > **Note:**  After you apply tags, you can retrieve all the resources in your subscription with that tag name and value. Tags enable you to retrieve related resources from different resource groups. This approach is helpful when you need to organize resources for billing or management.[Learn more.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-using-tags)
    
    > **Note:** In this scenario we are not creating any tags for categorizing resources.

1. Click **Next : Review + create >** to review the settings and **Create a virtual machine** blade will be displayed with a **Validation passed** message at the top of the blade
1. Click **Create** to deploy the virtual machine that has been configured

    > **Note:** Deployment of the virtual machine can take up to 10 minutes. You can check the status of the virtual machine deployment by clicking on the notification (Bell) icon at the top of the page. While you can wait for the deployment to succeed before continuing to the next scenario, you can continue with subsequent steps while the deployment completes. 

This completes this scenario. Click **Next** to go to the next scenario.
