## **Scenario 1 - Building a Virtual Network**
An **Azure virtual network** (VNet) is a representation of your own **network**  in the cloud. It is a logical isolation of the **Azure** cloud dedicated to your subscription. You can fully control the IP address blocks, DNS settings, security policies and route tables within this **network.** [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview).
