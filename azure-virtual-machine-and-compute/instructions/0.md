# Lab 01 - Building a Virtual Network

### Estimated Duration: 30 Minutes

## Lab Scenario

You are a Cloud Administrator for Contoso Ltd., tasked with creating a secure and isolated networking environment in Azure for upcoming application deployments. In this lab, you will design and build an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) from scratch using the Azure portal. You will configure custom IP address ranges, create a dedicated subnet, and validate the deployment to ensure that it meets your organization’s networking requirements. This virtual network will serve as the foundation for securely hosting virtual machines, application services, and other Azure resources in future projects.

### Objectives

In this lab you will complete the following task:

- Task 1: Building a Virtual Network

### Task 1: Building a Virtual Network

In this task, you will create an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) from the Azure portal. You will define the network’s basic settings, configure IP address space, and create a dedicated subnet to segment resources. This will establish a secure and isolated environment for hosting Azure services and enable controlled connectivity between them.

1. On the Azure portal, click on **+ Create a resource**.

4. On the **Basics** tab of Create virtual network blade, enter the following information:
    
    -  Subscription: **Accept default subscription (1)**.
    
    -  Resource group: Select the exisiting resource group named **azvmrg-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/> (2)**
    
    -  Name: **DemoLabVnet1 (3)**
    
       > **Note:** If the portal advises the name is not unique, simply adjust the name. Once you create a unique name that is available, you will see a check mark at the end of the **Name** field.

    -  Region: Select **<inject key="Region" enableCopy="false"/>** **(4)**.

    -  Click on **Next : Security (5)**.

7.  On **Add a subnet** tab enter the following details: 

      - Subnet Purpose: **Leave the default one**
   
      - Name: **demolabsubnet (1)**

      - IPv4 address range: Select **10.2.0.0/24 (2)** from the drop down
      
      - Starting address: **10.2.0.0 (3)**
      
      - Size : Select **/26 (64 addresses) (4)** from the drop down.
      
      - Click on **Add (5)**.
