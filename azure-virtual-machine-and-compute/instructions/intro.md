# Azure Virtual Machine and Compute

### Overall Estimated Duration: 240 minutes

## Overview

Microsoft Azure is one of the leading enterprise cloud platforms. Azure launched in 2010 and has quickly matured as many new services are continually being added. One of the first and most popular services offered in Azure is **Virtual Machines**, an IaaS solution.

This lab will walk you through the steps to create and deploy a Windows Server 2019 Datacenter virtual machine. We will also configure a backup of the virtual machine that will be user-accessible for recovery. You will also be able to load a web application in the VM you have just provisioned in Azure.

The lab will include the following exercises:

1. **Building a Virtual Network:** Create a secure and isolated network in Azure to connect and manage cloud resources.

1. **Create an Azure Availability Set:** Configure multiple virtual machines in Azure to ensure high availability and resilience against failures.

1. **Deploy a Virtual Machine:** Provision a virtual machine in Azure with selected operating system and configuration settings.

1. **Backup and Recovery:** Set up backup policies and procedures to protect data and applications in Azure, ensuring business continuity.

1. **Virtual Machine Data Disk and Overview:** Manage and utilize data disks for Azure virtual machines to enhance storage capacity and performance.

1. **Connect to the VM and Install IIS:** Access an Azure virtual machine and install Internet Information Services (IIS) for hosting web applications.

1. **Azure Monitor:** Monitor and analyze the performance, health, and usage of Azure resources and applications for optimization and troubleshooting.

## Objective

Participants in these labs will gain practical experience in Azure cloud infrastructure management. 

- Build secure virtual networks, ensure high availability with Azure Availability Sets, and deploy customized virtual machines supporting various workloads.
- Hands-on activities include implementing robust backup strategies, managing data disks for optimized storage performance, and connecting to VMs to install and configure IIS for web hosting.
- Monitor and optimize Azure resources using Azure Monitor, enhancing performance, availability, and security through metrics, alerts, and diagnostic tools.
- These labs collectively equip participants with essential skills in network configuration, VM deployment, data management, application hosting, and cloud monitoring within the Azure ecosystem.
