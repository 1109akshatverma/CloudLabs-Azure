## Building a .NET Core Blazor website
Now that the controllers have been modernized with Azure Functions, Azure CosmosDB, and Authentication, we need to create a website to view and manage our todo items.

```
Depending on time, you can skip straight to the Test on a live site section to test right away.
```

Unlike a traditional website that requires running on a webserver 24/7, Blazor enables you to write static single page applications that can dynamically render on the client browser. These websites can be deployed as static files to a storage account + CDN (Content Delivery Network), and accessible over the internet without needing a web server. This can provide incredibly elastic scale at minimal cost.
1. Close **Visual Studio** if it is still open
2. On the desktop, double-click to open **Visual Studio Code**
3. Select **File** and then **Open** Folder
4. Navigate to Desktop, select **ServerlessApp** and click on **app**
5. Select **blazor-todo** and then click **Folder**

      > This will open a blazor app that will act as the website.
      
6. Open **Pages** and select **Index.razor**

      >	Notice that this is very familiar to the Index.cshtml file we looked at in our legacy app. The difference is Blazor is optimzed as a dynamically renderable single page application, and can also run as a serverless website
      
      > This page specifically will list the todo items for the current user
      
Feel free to click around other files in the project to try to get a feel for how a Blazor file is made up and what it is doing (there are only a few files in the project)

### Running the blazor app locally

1. In **Visual Studio Code**, select on the top menu Terminal and then select **New Terminal**
2. In the terminal window that appears at the bottom, type **dotnet run** and press **Enter**

     > This will build and start running your blazar app locally on your virtual machine
     
3. After a few moments you should see some URLs listed that you can test like http://localhost:5000
4. Open a web browser on the virtual machine and go to http://localhost:5000
