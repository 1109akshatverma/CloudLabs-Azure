Notice the available functions are listed for testing. This project is already hooked up to a live CosmosDB account. Leave the function project running and open a web browser on the virtual machine to test the GetTodos function at http://localhost:7071/api/todo. You should see some test todo items returned.
 
 >After testing the function, you can close the web browser, close the Azure Functions runtime, and stop the debug session.
