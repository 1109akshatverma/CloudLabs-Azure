 > Wait for the function to run from the console and open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:7071/api/todo which will return an empty data since we dont have any records in **CosmosDB**
  
 
 > After testing the function, you can close the web browser, close the Azure Functions runtime, and stop the debug session.
