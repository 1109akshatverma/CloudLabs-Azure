## Creating Serverless Functions
Let's start by moving the business logic from this legacy app to serverless functions. As stated above, the logic from the Controller methods will become Azure Functions (Get, Update, and Delete todo item APIs).

Perform the below steps to add an Azure Function project to this solution:

1.	Right click the Solution **'TodoSolution'** in the Solution Explorer
2.	Select **Add** and then click **New Project**

    ![Todosolution](images/todosolution.png)

3.	Scroll or search for **Azure Functions** and click **Next**
4.	Give the project a name or leave as default
5.	Click **Create**
6.	Since we will be creating HTTP APIs like the legacy controller, select the **Http Trigger** template, change the **Access Rights** to anonymous, and click **Create**

>Visual Studio will now generate a new Azure Functions project with an HTTP triggered function called Function1.cs. Open the **Function1.cs** file. You can customize this function to trigger on different routes, return different results, and have different levels of authentication. 

>Rather than spending the time to code a full todo app, let's switch to opening a project that already has the HTTP Trigger code written.
