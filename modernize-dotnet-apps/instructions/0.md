##Introduction

The objective of this lab is to take you through modernizing a legacy ASP.NET MVC app using serverless tools and patterns. The app is a simple todo app, and after completing all tasks you should have an understanding of how many of the patterns of traditional server apps can map to serverless - including Azure Functions, App Service Authentication, Azure Storage, Azure CosmosDB, and Blazor with .NET Core.
