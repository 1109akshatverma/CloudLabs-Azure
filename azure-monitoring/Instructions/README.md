## Guidance
Biggest issues I have seen when deploying the workshop are around compute quotas, changing the region to one that does not support the Azure Monitor preview, not having contributor role membership to the subscription and local machine issues.  If you run into a student who cannot seem to get her or his computer working with the Azure CLI, have them use the Azure Cloud Shell.  Remember to copy up the ARM template and parameters JSON files before kicking off the deployment.  
I highly recommend your students make sure they have an Azure Subscription they have contributor role access to before day one of the hack.<br/>
