# Challenge 2: Monitoring and Alert Rule Automation Challenge	

1. Update the parameters file and deployment script for the `GenerateAlertRules.json` template located in the AlertTemplates folder<br/>
2. Add the names of your `VMs` and `ResouceId` for your `Action Group`<br/>
3. Deploy the `GenerateAlertRules.json` template using the sample PowerShell script (deployAlertRulesTemplate.ps1) or create a Bash script (look at the example from the initial deployment)<br/>
4. Verify you have new `Monitor Alert Rules` in the Portal or from the command line (sample command is in the PowerShell deployment script using new `Az` Monitor cmdlets)<br/>
5. Modify the `GenerateAlertsRules.json` to include `Disk Write Operations/Sec` and set a threshold of `20`<br/>
6. Rerun your template and verify your new `Alert Rules` are created for each of your `VMs`<br/>
7. Create a new `Action Rule` that suppress alerts from the scale set and virtual machines on `Saturday` and `Sunday`<br/>

#### First team to me a screenshot of the new Alert Rules and Action Rule wins the challenge!! Good luck!
