# Challenge 5: Log Analytics Query Challenge

1. Write a performance query that renders a time chart for the last 4 hours for both of the `Web Servers` and the `SQL Server` for the following perf metrics. Save each query to your favorites.

   * Processor Utilization: `Processor / % Processor Time`
   
   * Memory Utilization: `Memory / % Committed Bytes In Use`
   
   * Disk Utilization (IO): `Disk Reads/sec and Disk Writes/sec`
   
3. Create a heartbeat query for `Web Servers` and `SQL Server`

4. Write a `performance query` that renders a time chart for the last hour of the max percentage `CPU` usage of the AKS Cluster nodes



## First team with a screenshots of the time charts wins the Challenge!! Good Luck!



### Optional Logs Challenge

* Combine infrastructure and application logs to create a single timeseries chart that includes: 
   * CPU usage from the node in your `AKS` cluster hosting the eshoponweb app
   * Duration of page views on your `eshoponweb` app hosted on the cluster
